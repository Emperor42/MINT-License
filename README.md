# MINT-License
A modified MIT license with an additional term stipulating that this work is not to be leveraged to create or support software systems for use in weapons or related technology.

The text of this license is effectively a full copy of the MIT license, with a term directly stating that the work licensed is not able to be used in the following:
1)  Weapons-related systems (Targeting systems for example)
2)  Systems supporting weapons systems (Gun or weapons platforms)
3)  Any systems which can directly or indirectly be used to facilitate violence

Use of the system will result in the user owing 1 billion euros to the copyright holder. The idea of the fee hopefully would provide a deterrent for leveraging the licensed works in the above-mentioned systems. Full disclosure, I do not know if this is enforceable, nor do I know if this license will be found to be useful or accepted in the open-source community. I firmly believe in open-source systems we are reaching a point in their development where software, specifically AI, can be easily leveraged to facilitate massive violence. Effectively we have systems with the potential to greenlight hundreds of collateral deaths or casualties to achieve a given goal based on the whims of a small few individuals.
